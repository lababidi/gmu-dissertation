In the frame work of the model, three cases of different grain size and orientation distribution were analyzed to quantitatively describe the size and orientation effects. Then numerical simulations on the mechanical behaviors of the different cases were performed to figure out the grain size and orientation effects on the overall mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline materials. Especially, the coupled effect of grain size and orientation on the local shear deformation was analyzed and discussed."

This expression is used to analyze the deformation fields for a one-dimensional atomic chain, a biaxially stretched thin film containing a surface ledge, and a FCC metal subject to indentation loading from a nanometer-scale indenter. The analyses presented show that the metric established here is consistent with the continuum mechanical concept of deformation gradient (which is known to have a zero curl for compatible deformations) in most instances. However, our metric does yield non-zero values of curl for atoms near loaded geometric inhomogeneities, such as those that form the ledges themselves and those beneath or adjacent to the indentation contact region. Also, we present expressions for higher order gradients of the deformation field and discuss the requirements for their calculation. These expressions are necessary for linking atomistic simulation results with advanced continuum mechanics theories such as strain gradient plasticity, thereby enabling fundamental, atomic-scale information to contribute to the formulation and parameterization of such theories."

abstract = "Lack of corrosion resistance of structural steel has resulted in many structural failures. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bar is emerging as a viable solution to replace steel to mitigate corrosion problems. Since FRP is a brittle material, it can bring about catastrophic sudden structural failures. Conversely, post-earthquake recovery of structures is another prime objective for performance based seismic design. Shape memory alloy (SMA) has the unique ability to undergo large inelastic deformation and regain its undeformed shape through stress removal. Here a hybrid reinforced concrete (RC) column configuration is presented in order to reduce permanent damages, and enhance its corrosion resistance capacity where the plastic hinge region will be reinforced with SMA or stainless steel and the remaining regions with FRP or stainless steel rebar. An analytical investigation has been carried out to develop such hybrid RC columns and analyze them under seismic loadings. The results are compared in terms of base shear-tip displacement, base shear demand/capacity ratio, ductility, residual displacement, and energy dissipation capacity to those of a similar RC column reinforced with stainless steel. The results indicate that such corrosion resistant hybridized column can substantially reduce the residual displacement with adequate energy dissipation capacity during earthquakes."

abstract={Wireless and/or sensorless components offer a great potential for friendly integration in mechatronic systems. This paper presents a wireless technique to actuate a bistable curved beam using wavelength-selective shape-memory-alloy (SMA) thin foils. The SMA thin foil is irradiated remotely by continuous-mode laser diodes of 785 and 658 nm wavelengths. First, a comparison between two numerical thermal models is done. These models obey the same conduction and convection equations but the effect of phase transformation is integrated in two different ways. A good agreement is found between the two simulation results. Then, the force generated by the SMA sample (size: 3 mm #x00D7; 1 mm #x00D7; 0.1 mm), during martensite-to-austenite phase transformation, is experimentally measured using a miniature force sensor. The force comes out to be 403 mN with 70 mW laser power. Using this force value, a bistable curved beam is designed and fabricated by rapid prototyping technique. Optical filtering layers, which are responsible for the wavelength-selective response, are directly deposited onto the SMA samples. Finally, two SMA samples are used to switch the curved beam between its two stable positions.},

 the effect of chemical composition and uniaxial mechanical stresses on the martensitic phase transfor
mation in Ni-rich NiAl alloys. The martensitic phase has a tetragonal crystal structure and can contai
n multiple twins arranged in domains and plates. The transformation is reversible and is characterized
 by a significant temperature hysteresis. The magnitude of the hysteresis depends on the chemical comp
osition and stress. We show that applied compressive and tensile stresses reduce and can even eliminat
e the hysteresis. Crystalline defects such as free surfaces, dislocations and anti-phase boundaries re
duce the martensitic transformation temperature and affect the microstructure of the martensite. Their
 effect can be explained by heterogeneous nucleation of the new phase in defected regions.}

  OPTabstract =  {Cleavage fracture of B2 aluminide single crystals, including FeAl, NiAl and CoAl, has been investigated at temperatures below their ductile-brittle transition temperatures. Single-edge notched bend specimens oriented along specific crystalline directions were tested by 4-point bending. The fracture resistance was highly anisotropic because of the existence of a preferred cleavage plane in these B2 aluminide crystals. With a deep through notch NiAl and CoAl crystals that have high ordering energies generally cleave on \{110\} planes, while substoichiometric FeAl having a low ordering energy shows \{100\} cleavage as do most b.c.c. metals. In the case of NiAl, a transition fracture region, composed of fracture facets on \{511\} transient planes, appears at the initial cracking stage, followed by final cleavage on \{11p\}. Different stoichiometric effects on the fracture toughness of B2 aluminides are observed when the Al concentration is reduced. A general discussion on different mechanistic models has been used to explain the preferred cleavage planes in B2 structures. The intrinsic fracture toughness of an aluminide crystal can be dtermined by an ideal fracture test in which the cleavage plane is parallel to the notch plane and is normal to the applied stress. Because of geometric constraint an increased fracture resistance is obtained when the natural cleavage plane is not parallel to the notch plane, and the anisotropy of fracture toughness can be explained by a simple approach of resolved normal stress intensity.},

  OPTabstract =  {Interatomic potentials fo the embedded atom and embedded defect type were derived for the Co-Al system by empirical fitting to the properties of the B2 CoAl phase. The embedded atom potentials reproduced most of the properties needed, except that, in using this method, the elastic constants cannot be fitted exactly because CoAl has a negative Cauchy pressure. In order to overcome this limitation and fit the elastic constants correctly, angular forces to the embedded atom potentials were added using the embedded defect technique. The effects of angular forces to the embedded atom potentials were seen in the elastic constants, particularly $C_{44}$. Planar fault energies changed up to 30\% in the \{110\} and \{112\} $\gamma$ surfaces and the vacancy formation energies were also very sensitive to the non-central forces. Dislocation core structures and Peierls stress values were computed for the $\leftangle 100\rightangle$ and $\leftangle 111\rightangle$ dislocations without angular forces. As a general result, the dislocations with a planar core moved for critical stress values below 250 MPa in contrast with the nonplanar cores for which the critical stress values were above 1500 MPa. The easiest dislocations to move were the 1/2$\leftangle 111\rightangle$ edge superpartials, and the overall preferred slip plane was \{110\}. These results were compared with experimental ovservations in CoAl and previously simulated dislocations in NiAl.},

Magnetic measurements have revealed the clear relation of coercivity with the volume ratio of hcp phase. That is, the increase in the hcp phase considerably enhances the coercivity. Appearance of the hcp phase seems to be related to the promotion of allotropic phase transformation in Co initiated by lattice defects within each particle.},

Single crystals of cobalt were grown oriented for basal slip and deformed in compression. The dissociation of the basal glide dislocations into partials is resolved; the arrangement of the magnetic domains does not influence the splitting width of the partials. From a careful analysis of the observed image peak separations, a room-temperature stacking-fault energy $\gamma=27\pm4$\,mJ\,m$^{-2}$ is deduced. The basal glide dislocations contain many jogs. Frequently the sequence of the partials is reversed at a jog, which leads to the conclusion that the dislocationis jogging over an odd number of lattice planes and has a staking fault of the same intrinsic type \bf{I}$_2$ on both sides of the jog. It should be pointed out that in the f.c.c. structure this behaviour has not been observed, since the reversed sequence of the partials would lead to a glide dislocation containing an extrinsic fault.},

The peak of the distribution of hyperfine fields in bcc Co occurs at 167 MHz, much lower than the value found for fcc Co (217 MHz), suggesting that the moment in the bcc phase is lower than that of the fcc phase, in agreement with the measurements of Prinz, but in disagreement with recent theoretical calculations (assuming that no significant structural differences exist between theory and experiment). The full width of the distribution is 75 MHz, seven times greater than that found in thin fcc Co films.

The correlation among the states in the partially filled 3$d$ band, the Hubband correlation, is found to be the most important contributor to the binding, with significant comtribution from other types of correlation effects involving the core and band electrons. The balance of the cohesive energy arises from one-electron-type effects, primarily from the increased number of 3$d$-like electrons as compared to the atom. This results in an increased attractive interaction of the 3$d$-like electrons with the nucleus, the total kinetic energy from these states being also reduced by the hybridization of the 3$d$ states with the orthogonalized plane waves. This contribution to the cohesive energy from the 3$d$-like and free-like band states is +3.574 Ry which is significantly canceled by a compensating contribution of -3.409 Ry from the change in the energies of the core states.

In all cases there is a sharp drop in the graph of hysteresis vs. composition at the composition where $\lambda_2 = 1$.

Motivated by these experimental results, we present a new theory for the size of the hysteresis based on the growth from a small scale of fully developed austenite martensite needles. The energy of the transition layer plays a critical role in this theory. Overalll, the results point to a simple systematic method of achieving low hysteresis and a high degree of reversibility in transforming materials.},

The cross-interactions are fitted to experimental cohesive energy, lattice parameter and elastic constants of B2-NiAl, as well as to ab initio formation energies of several real or imaginary intermetallic compounds with different crystal structures and chemical compositions. The potential accurately reproduces a variety of physical properties of the NiAl and Ni3Al phases, and shows reasonable agreement with experimental and ab initio data for phase stability across the Ni-Al phase diagram. Most of the properties reproduced by the new potential were not involved in the fitting process, which demonstrates its excellent transferability. Advantages and certain weaknesses of the new potential in comparison with other existing potentials are discussed in detail. The potential is expected to be especially suitable for simulations of heterophase interfaces and mechanical behavior of Ni-Al alloys. }

An embedded-atom-method potential for NiAl alloy is applied, and a sequence of conditions including loading, unloading, heating and cooling is imposed. Two types of grain arrangement are used, and the deformation and shape recovery due to phase transformation are observed for both models. The stress-strain relation is revealed to draw a hysteresis loop, and the individual curves are smoother than those previously obtained from a single crystal model. The deformation mechanism during loading is discussed using local structure analysis. Local deformation is initiated at the grain boundaries, and the deformed region propagates along the twin plane in the grain. The propagation is then obstructed by the grain boundaries, and a band pattern of the deformed area is formed. The influence of the grain shape and distribution, as well as the crystal orientation of each grain, on the deformation behaviour is also investigated. Qualitatively common features in the deformation mechanism and stress-strain relation are observed despite different grain distributions, while the critical values in stress vary, owing to the crystal orientations of the grains.},

Stress induced and thermally activated martensitic transformations were studied in the cases that various defects were introduced into the simulated system. The simulation results show that the nucleation patterns were closely related to the stresses of the dislocation configurations, in the sense that the locations where stresses assist the lattice distortion of the transformation are favorable for martensite nucleation. A symmetric, tilt low-angle grain boundary is not favorable for martensite nucleation, because the stresses fo the constituent dislocations cancel one another and stresses that asist the lattice distortion cannot be produced. The low-angle boundary hinders the martensite growth due to the high stability of this type of dislocation configuration. A relaxed, high-angle grain boundary (coincident site lattice) is also not favorable for martensite nucleation, because of the lack of long-range stress field.},

The alloy exhibited large, recrystalliesed grains of the Ni-Al $\beta$ phase with spherical precipitates inside the grains and a thin layer of other phases located at the grain boundaries. The SEM and EDX analysis showed that both types of precipitates were composed of two intermetallic phases (Ni$_x$Al$_{1-x}$Y$_5$ with different Ni to Al ratio. No yttrium content has been detected in the matrix $\beta$ phase, probably because of the low solubility limit which is 0.1 at.\%. The martensitic transformation was studied by TEM and DSC calorimetry. In large grains of the recrystallised material the M$_s$ temperature was measured to be -4$\deg$C and the transformation proceeded in the range of 60 deg. The M$_s$ temperature was lower than expected from the ratio of Ni to Al. Aging 1 hour at 240$\deg$C did not influence the range of the transformation. The TEM study of the $\beta$ phase revealed strong and regular contrast modulations, probably being premartensitic effects. Also a regular spaced network of dislocations lying in the same directions as the contrast modulations, both in matrix and martensite, was noticed. In foils 7R structure of martensite, internally twinned, was predominantly found. The alloy was very brittle.},

  OPTabstract =  {Molecular dynamics (MD) study of martensitic transformation (MT) in nickel and aluminum alloy is performed. The behavior focused on is transformation between crystalline structure from B2 cubic cell to body-centered tetragonal cell, which is simply realized by uniaxial tensile loading. The potential function used is Finnis-Sinclair type having only single energy minimum where B2 structure exists. The availability of this specific many-body potential for stress-induced MT phenomena under uniaxial loading is fully discussed. In MD simulation, martensite phase is induced by tensile stress or strain in the atomic system as predicted by a potential energy map. It is understood that the characteristic of the potential energy function with regard to deformation is crucial for MT studies and investigating energy-strain or stress-strain map is worthwhile. The MT behavior in the atomic system occurs during a plateau region of stress-strain (S-S) curve of the whole specimen, that is typical for experimental superelastic or shape-memory alloys under uniaxial loading. It is found that, during each MT event, large jump of atomic strain is observed. Owing to single energy minimum, the atomic system shows almost perfect recovery in S-S curve, where the graph comes completely back to initial state after unloaded. Besides, the present paper focuses on surface effect for MT behavior. Since the surface effect is dominant in MT phenomena especially in microscopic specimens, a novel computational scheme for stabilizing condition in which uniaxial loading is always applied together with arbitrary periodic boundary condition(s) is devised. By comparing one-, two-, and three-dimensional models under uniaxial loading, it is recognized that the nucleation behavior depends strongly on the existence of free surface region (including corner edge). When there is no surface, a chaotic nucleation of martensite is observed. On the other hand, the free surface induces first martensite because of less constraint n tensile deformation of unit cell. It is confirmed that the tendency toward MT nucleation corresponds to yield stress or strain of the specimen. In order to define and detect martensite structure as for each atom, an atomic strain measure (ASM) with our own formation is introduced. It is shown that the ASM is very effective to distinguish martensite bct unit structure from others.},

Vacancies and antisites are introduced into numerous positions in embedded atom simulation blocks containing $[100](001)$ as well as $[100](01\bar{1})$ pure edge dislocations. The interaction of these point defects with the dislocation is quantified by calculating the change in total energy experienced by the simulated lattice. An off-stoichiometry Ni-rish alloy is generated by randomly substituting Ni atoms for Al atoms as well as simply deleting Al atoms from the perfect lattice structure. It was found that a 2\% deviation from stoichiometry affects the shapes of dislocation cores in that they tend to lose their preference for the well-defined crystallographic planes seen in the stoichiometric alloy. Stoichiometry deviations also increase the non-planar spreading of the core as visualized using the strain invariant method. It was found that Al vacancies are strongly attracted to the dislocation core and produce much more significant changes in the core structure than antisites or Ni vacancies do. The Peierls stresses were found to increase significantly for the alloy when off-stoichiometry. The interaction of antisites with the dislocation core is not as strong, although the Peierls stress is still found to increase. The simulations suggest that an entirely different core structure may be stable for the off-stoichiometric alloys.},

We found that dislocations in FeAl show a strong tendency for splitting into two superpartials, in contrast with NiAl.

  OPTannote = 	 {Aluminides with the B2 structure have poor ductility. NiAl is considered to be intrinsically brittle. With FLMTO the equilibrium lattice constant of NiAl is $2.839\,\AA$. The cleavage energy $G_c$ is defined as the energy required to cleave an infinite bulk crystal into two semi-infinite parts, and so is the energy to be applied for the creation of two surfaces. In the supercell approach, $G_c$ is calculated as the total-energy difference per unit surface area. In the case of the B2 structure, the supercell geometry is essentially differrent for the $\{100\}$ and $\{110\}$ planes. The $\{100\}$ plane consists of only one type of atom (Al or Ni), and so this plane is polar and causes some difficulties in the cleavage energy estimates. The $\{110\}$ plane contains both Ni and Al atoms, i.e., it is nonpolar, and in this case $G_c$ was calculated in the usual manner. The energy of separation of two halves of the crystal as a function of distance $E_{cl}(u)$ was then determined by varying the thickness of the vacuum slab. The maximum derivative of $E_{cl}(u)$ is the so-called theoretical cleavage strength $(\sigma_{max})$.}

Within a smaller interval of 10 K near the upper limit of the stability of the martensitic phase no strain broadening of x-ray diffraction lines was observed for either phase. With decreasing temperature, diffraction profiles broaden, with a maximum reached when the sample is fully transformed into the martensitic phase. This observation is analyzed in terms of heterogeneous strain broadening due to imperfect microstructural self-accomodation of the martensitic grains. No strain broadening occurs when the martensitic phase is not fully interconnected but forms isolated islands inside an austenite matrix. It is concluded that large stress fields result from the coalescence of martensitic regions in the sample. The calibration of the excess entropy from the measurements of the specific heat confirms the Landau potential of Salje et al (2007 Appl. Phys. Lett. 90 221903). Imperfect self-accomodation does not contribute to a measurable increase of the entropy of the sample.}

This temperature dependence is related to the lack of any transformations of the compound, which remains ordered up to the melting temperature. The measured enthalpies were combined with other thermodynamic data to estimate the excess entropy of formation of Ni3Al. The high degree of ordering in the compound is reflected in the large negative value of the excess entropy, whose absolute value exceeds those for other high melting temperature intermetallic compounds. The full-potential linearized augmented Slater-type orbital method (FLASTO) was used to calculate the enthalpies of formation of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic Ni$_3$Al.

Tweed is a mottled structure that is observed prior to transformations such as martensitic transformations. In some cases, it has been found to accompany $\omega$-phase formation. The simulations were performed on two different types of Ni$_{62.5}$Al$_{37.5}$, one ordered and one disordered, each containing 1024 atoms (8$\times$8$\times$8 bcc unit cells) with a lattice parameter of 2.88\AA. In a stoichiometric Ni-Al B2 structure, Al atoms were replaced by the extra Ni atoms at random (disordered array) and in a regular ordered pattern (ordered array) in order to achieve 62.5-37.5 composition without any change in the type of cell. There are many ways of randomly distributing the ``extra'' Ni atoms on the Al sublattice, and to study the influence of this factor a run was performed at 10 K for 3000 steps (90ps) for two configurationally different disordered B2 arrays. The simulations were based upon EAM potentials developed by Voter and Chen. In the disordered B2 array, diffuse streakings were observed mainly along the $\langle 110\rangle$ directions but some also along the $\langle 112\rangle$ direction. The $\langle 112\rangle$ streaking is usually associated with the formation of the $\omega$ phase. However, with the ordered array, virtually no streaking appeared, strongly suggesting that heterogeneous defects (such as compositional disorder) are necessary to induce both tweed structure and the $\omega$ phase. Again $\langle 110\rangle\{100\}$ shears were noticed in the disordered lattice.},

  pages = {3060-3083},
  annote = {Canonical linearization reference},
  abstract = {Two approximate methods for solving the band-structure problem
             in an efficient and physically transparent way are presented and
             discussed in detail. The variational principle for the
             one-electron Hamiltonian is used in both schemes, and the trial
             functions are linear combinations of energy-independent augmented
             plane waves (APW) and muffin-tin orbitals (MTO), respectively.
             The secular equations are therefore eigenvalue equations, linear
             in energy. The trial functions are defined with respect to a
             muffin-tin (MT) potential and the energy bands depend on the
             potential in the spheres through potential parameters which
             describe the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivatives.
             Inside the spheres, the energy-independent APW is that linear
             combination of an exact solution, at the arbitrary but fixed
             energy $E_{nu}$, and its energy derivative which matches
             continuously and differentiably onto the plane-wave part in the
             interstitial region. The energies obtained with the linear-APW
             method for the MT potential have errors of order $(E-E_v)^4$.
             Similarly, the energy-independent MTO is that linear combination
             which matches onto that solution of the Laplace equation in the
             interstitial region which is regular at infinity. The energies
             obtained with the linear-MTO method have additional errors of
             order $(E-V_{mtz})^2$, arising from the interstitial region where
             the potential is $V_{mtz}$. The linear-APW (LAPW) method combines
             desirable features of the APW and OPW methods; it can treat d
             bands, the energy dependence of its pseudopotential is linear
             and, owing to the smoothness of the energy-independent APW at the
             spheres, non-MT contributions to the potential are included
             principally through their Fourier components. The linear-MTO
             (LMTO) method is particularly suited for closely packed
             structures and it combines desirable features of
             Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker, linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals,
             and cellular methods; the secular matrix is linear in energy, the
             overlap integrals factorize as potential parameters and structure
             constants, the latter are canonical in the sense that they
             neither depend on the energy nor the cell volume and they specify
             the boundary conditions on a single MT or atomic sphere in the
             most convenient way. This method is very well suited for
             self-consistent calculations. The empty-lattice test is applied
             to the linear-MTO method and the free-electron energy bands are
             accurately reproduced. Finally, it is shown how relativistic
             effects may be included in both the LAPW and LMTO methods.},

  OPTnote = {The $\alpha$-phase, which is a face-centred cubic solid solution of aluminium in nickel, extends to 89 atomic \% of nickel at room temperatures. The $\alpha$'-phase, which is a face-centred cubic solid solution closely corresponding to the composition Ni$_3$Al, has a suprelattice (Westgren and Ekman 1930), nickel atoms occupying centres of cube faces and aluminium atoms cube corners.Instead of a phase NiAl$_2$ we have found a solid solution extending from 37.2 to 41.3\% of nickel, corresponding to the formula Ni$_2$Al$_3$($\delta$-phase) which is supported by the structural analysis. The space group is D$_{3d}^3$. The structure is trigonal with five atoms per unit cell, which in ideal case consists of three aluminium atoms and two nickel atoms. The lattice spacings of the $\delta$-alloys change continuously through the phase, but the values for the ideal composition (Ni$_2$Al$_3$) may be taken as typical: a=4.0282\AA, c=4.8906\AA, c/a=1.2141. The existence of the inter-metallic compound NiAl$_3$ is confirmed. The lattice spacings of Ni$_3$Al were found to vary with various heat treatments; typical range: 3.58\AA-3.56\AA. The lattice constant of $\beta$-phase (CsCl type) centred at the composition NiAl is 2.8813\AA. In agreement with Gwyer's diagram, a phase ($\epsilon$-phase) was found at the exact composition NiAl$_3$ (Brunck 1901). It tolerates no excess of either nickel or aluminium. The space group is C$_2h^16$. There are four nickel atoms and twelve aluminium atoms in a unit cell of dimentions: a=6.5982\AA, b=7.3515\AA, c=4.8021\AA.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of calculating the vacancy
             formation energy in simple metals and presents results for
             aluminium. The calculations are based on the pseudopotential
             method, the local-density approximation for exchange and
             correlation, and periodically repeating geometry. The approach
             used is similar to that proposed by Car and Parrinello, and
             allows the simultaneous relaxation of the electrons and the ionic
             positions. Problems peculiar to metals in this approach are
             discussed and a way of overcoming them is presented. The
             calculated vacancy energy (0.56 eV) in aluminium is in quite good
             agreement with experiment (0.66 eV). Comparisons with
             perturbation theory show that the calculated value is subject to
             a technical error of only approximately 0.03 eV and that
             corrections due to periodic boundary conditions are also of this
             order. The contribution to the vacancy energy from non-linear
             effects is similar to the jellium estimate of Evans and Finnis.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting
             electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that
             there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)],
             independent of v(r), such that the expression E=$\int$
             [v(r)n(r)dr]+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct
             ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)]
             is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+\~n(r), \~n /
             n0 $<<$ 1, and (2) n(r)= $\phi$ (r / r0) with $\phi$ arbitrary
             and r0$\rightarrow \infty$. In both cases F can be expressed
             entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher
             order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This
             approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi
             methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these
             methods are presented.},

  abstract = {Band-structure calculations frequently use an occupation-number
             broadening method to approximate integrals involving the
             electronic density of states. The underlying assumptions of these
             techniques are frequently unstated and can lead to erroneous
             results. In particular, a sampling of recent papers shows that
             very few authors check the behavior of the integrals as a
             function of the broadening parameter (temperature). The correct
             temperature for one calculation may not be correct for another
             calculation in the same system. This paper uses a tight-binding
             calculation of the elastic constants in Niobium as an example of
             what can happen when the broadening parameter is not carefully
             applied.}

  journal = {Phys. Rev. B},

  number = 5,
  pages = {2493-2500},
  abstract = {I have carried out numerical first-principles calculations of
             the pressure dependence of the elastic moduli for several ordered
             structures in the aluminum-lithium system, specifically fcc Al,
             fcc and bcc Li, {\em L}1$_{2}$Al$_{3}$Li, and an ordered fcc
             Al$_{7}$Li supercell. The calculations were performed using the
             full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method (LAPW) to
             calculate the total energy as a function of strain, after which
             the data were fit to a polynomial function of the strain to
             determine the modulus. A procedure for estimating the errors in
             this process is also given. The predicted equilibrium lattice
             parameters are slightly smaller than found experimentally,
             consistent with other local-density-approximation (LDA)
             calculations. The computed elastic moduli are within
             approximately 10% of the experimentally measured moduli, provided
             the calculations are carried out at the experimental lattice
             constant. The LDA equilibrium shear modulus
             {\em C}$_{11}$-{\em C}$_{12}$ increases from 59.3 GPa in Al, to
             76.0 GPa in Al$_{7}$Li, to 106.2 GPa in Al$_{3}$Li. The modulus
             {\em C}$_{44}$ increases from 38.4 GPa in Al to 46.1 GPa in
             Al$_{7}$Li, then falls to 40.7 GPa in Al$_{3}$Li. All of the
             calculated elastic moduli increase with pressure with the
             exception of bcc Li, which becomes elastically unstable at about
             2 GPa, where {\em C}$_{11}$-{\em C}$_{12}$ vanishes.}

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is sugggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

             found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond
             of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4
             eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and
             molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density
             functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking
             whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5)
             The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li
             and Na by 3-4 % is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of
             solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy
             (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of
             a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with
             LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we
             find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with
             experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to
             visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and
             correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

             plane-wave basis. We found that these pseudopotentials are
             extremely efficient for the cases where the plane-wave expansion
             has a slow convergence, in particular, for systems containing
             first-row elements, transition metals, and rare-earth elements.
             The wide applicability of the pseudpopotentials are exemplified
             with plane-wave calculations for copper, zinc blende, diamond,
             a-quartz, rutile, and cerium.}

             obtained from calculations of the total energy per electron made
             with a 'bubble' (or random phase) type of dielectric function.
             The potential is found to be well represented by an analytic
             expression corresponding to a shifted and rescaled spin dependent
             Slater potential. To test this potential the momentum dependent
             spin susceptibility of an electron gas is calculated. The results
             compare favourably with available information from other
             calculations and from experiment. The potential obtained in this
