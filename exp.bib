	abstract = {We report measurements of the temperature dependence of the critical current, Ic, in Josephson junctions consisting of conventional superconducting banks of Nb and a weakly ferromagnetic interlayer of a {CuxNi1-x} alloy, with x around 0.5. With decreasing temperature Ic generally increases, but for specific thicknesses of the ferromagnetic interlayer, a maximum is found followed by a strong decrease down to zero, after which Ic rises again. Such a sharp cusp can be explained only by assuming that the junction changes from a 0-phase state at high temperatures to a π phase state at low temperatures.},

	abstract = {The dependence of the critical current density jc on the ferromagnetic interlayer thickness {dF} was determined for {Nb/Al2O3/Cu/Ni/Nb} Josephson tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic Ni interlayer thicknesses from very thin films (∼1 nm) upward and classified into F-layer thickness regimes showing a dead magnetic layer, exchange, exchange+anisotropy and total suppression of jc. The Josephson coupling changes from 0 to π as function of {dF}, and—very close to the crossover thickness—as function of temperature. The strong suppression of the supercurrent in comparison to nonmagnetic {Nb/Al2O3/Cu/Nb} junctions indicated that the insertion of a F layer leads to additional interface scattering. The transport inside the dead magnetic layer was in dirty limit. For the magnetically active regime fitting with both the clean and the dirty limit theories was carried out, indicating dirty limit condition, too. The results were discussed in the framework of literature.},
