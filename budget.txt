The money will be allocated towards two main goals. One is to present research in a talk at a large annual physics conference, the APS March Meeting. The total costs of the conference include flight (300 USD), hotel for five days (700 USD), and daily costs of food and miscellaneous expenses such as local transportation (300). 
The other portion will be allocated towards doing traveling to Atlanta, Georgia to collaborate with the Jiang condensed matter research group at Georgia Institute of Technology. The money will help cover travel costs, lodging (both short term and long term). 
This should roughly be about 3000 USD.
