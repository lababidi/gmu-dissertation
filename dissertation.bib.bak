The tunneling spectra of these surface Andreev bound states agree well with a recent point-contact spectroscopy experiment [ S. Sasaki et al. Phys. Rev.

The method is applicable to any pure bulk superconductor described by a pair potential with arbitrary spatial dependence, in the presence of supercurrents and external magnetic field. We find that both the local density of states and the free energy density of an inhomogeneous superconductor can be expressed in terms of the diagonal resolvent of the corresponding Andreev Hamiltonian, which obeys the so-called {Gelfand-Dikii} equation. Also, the connection between the well known Eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical Green’s function and the less known {Gelfand-Dikii} equation for the diagonal resolvent of the Andreev Hamiltonian is established.

	abstract = {We study proximity effects in clean nanoscale superconductor–normal-metal–superconductor {(S∣N∣S)} graphene heterostructures using a self-consistent numerical solution to the continuum Dirac Bogoliubov–de Gennes {(DBdG)} equations. We obtain results for the pair amplitude and the local density of states {(DOS)} as a function of doping and of the geometrical parameters determining the width of the structures. The superconducting correlations are found to penetrate the normal graphene layers even when there is extreme mismatch in the normal and superconducting doping levels, where specular Andreev reflection dominates. The local {DOS} exhibits peculiar features, which we discuss, arising from the Dirac cone dispersion relation and from the interplay between the superconducting and Thouless energy scales. The corresponding characteristic energies emerge in the form of resonant peaks in the local {DOS}, which depend strongly on the doping level, as does the energy gap, which declines sharply as the relative difference in doping between the S and N regions is reduced. We also linearize the {DBdG} equations and develop an essentially analytical method that determines the critical temperature Tc of a {S∣N∣S} nanostructure self-consistently. We find that for S regions that occupy a fraction of the coherence length, Tc can undergo substantial variations as a function of the relative doping. At finite temperatures and by manipulating the doping levels, the self-consistent pair amplitudes reveal dramatic transitions between a superconducting and resistive normal state of the structure. Such behavior suggests the possibility of using the proposed system as a carbon-based superconducting switch, turning superconductivity on or off by tuning the relative doping levels.},

The two-dimensional {(2D)} topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional {(3D)} topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized {2D} Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on {HgTe∕CdTe} quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on {Bi1−xSbx}, {Bi2Se3}, {Bi2Te3}, and {Sb2Te3} are then discussed that establish these materials as {3D} topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a {3D} topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

In topological insulators and superconductors the bulk-surface and bulk-vortex correspondence gives rise to the gapless Weyl, Dirac or Majorana fermions on the surface of the system and inside vortex cores. Here we show that in gapless topological media, the bulk-surface and bulk-vortex correspondence is more effective: it produces topologically protected gapless fermions without dispersion - the flat band. Fermion zero modes forming the flat band are localized on the surface of topological media with protected nodal lines {[Schnyder}, Ryu, {2010,Heikkila}, Volovik, 2010b] and in the vortex core in systems with topologically protected Fermi points {(Weyl} points) {[Volovik}, 2010].

However, we also propose other examples of such systems, which are easier to realize experimentally. We find that each interface between a region on the edge coupled to a superconductor and a region coupled to a ferromagnet corresponds to a non-abelian anyon of quantum dimension \${\textbackslash}sqrt{2m}\$. We calculate the unitary transformations that are associated with braiding of these anyons, and show that they are able to realize a richer set of non-abelian representations of the braid group than the set realized by non-abelian anyons based on Majorana fermions. We carry out this calculation both explicitly and by applying general considerations. Finally, we show that topological manipulations with these anyons cannot realize universal quantum computation.},

The two-dimensional topological insulator phase was predicted in {HgTe} quantum wells and confirmed by transport measurements. Recently, {Bi2Se3} and related materials have been proposed as three-dimensional topological insulators with a single Dirac cone on the surface, protected by time-reversal symmetry. The topological surface states have been observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. However, few transport measurements in this context have been reported, presumably owing to the predominance of bulk carriers from crystal defects or thermal excitations. Here we show unambiguous transport evidence of topological surface states through periodic quantum interference effects in layered single-crystalline {Bi2Se3} nanoribbons, which have larger surface-to-volume ratios than bulk materials and can therefore manifest surface effects. Pronounced {Aharonov–Bohm} oscillations in the magnetoresistance clearly demonstrate the coherent propagation of two-dimensional electrons around the perimeter of the nanoribbon surface, as expected from the topological nature of the surface states. The dominance of the primary h/e oscillation, where h is Planck’s constant and e is the electron charge, and its temperature dependence demonstrate the robustness of these states. Our results suggest that topological insulator nanoribbons afford promising materials for future spintronic devices at room temperature.},

In high carrier density samples, the two probes also agree in the exact position of the Fermi level {EF}, but for lower carrier density samples discrepancies emerge in the position of {EF.} In particular, {SdH} reveals a bulk three-dimensional Fermi surface for samples with carrier densities as low as 1017 cm−3.

	abstract = {We systematically study topological phases of insulators and superconductors (or superfluids) in three spatial dimensions. We find that there exist three-dimensional ({3D)} topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z2 topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such {3D} topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (px±ipy)-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to “weak pairing”) and topologically trivial (analogous to “strong pairing”) {3D} phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior. When an electromagnetic U(1) gauge field and fluctuations of the gap functions are included in the dynamics, the superconducting phases with nonvanishing winding number possess nontrivial topological ground-state degeneracies.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional ({2D)} topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional ({3D)} topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized {2D} Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on {HgTe∕CdTe} quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on {Bi1−xSbx}, {Bi2Se3}, {Bi2Te3}, and {Sb2Te3} are then discussed that establish these materials as {3D} topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a {3D} topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

Furthermore, the Dirac electronic states mediate an {RKKY} interaction among the magnetic impurities which is always ferromagnetic, whenever the chemical potential lies near the Dirac point. Through this exchange mechanism, magnetic atoms uniformly deposited on the surface of a topological insulator could naturally form a ferromagnetically ordered film. These effects can be directly measured in {STM} experiments. We also study the case of quenched disorder through a renormalization group analysis.},

These topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal-breaking quantum Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions. The {TRI} quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimensions can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental {TRI} insulator in 4+1 dimensions through a dimensional reduction procedure. The effective topological field theory and the Z2 topological classification for the {TRI} insulators in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions are naturally obtained from this procedure. All physically measurable topological response functions of the {TRI} insulators are completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective topological field theory predicts a number of measurable phenomena, the most striking of which is the topological magnetoelectric effect, where an electric field generates a topological contribution to the magnetization in the same direction, with a universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine-structure constant α=e2∕ℏc. Finally, we present a general classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions and describe them in terms of a unified topological Chern-Simons field theory in phase space.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by the spin-orbit interaction that are different from conventional insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z2 topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z2 invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z2 invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z2 invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy {Bi1−xSbx} as well as α-Sn and {HgTe} under uniaxial strain. This paper also includes an expanded discussion of our formulation of the topological insulators in both two and three dimensions, as well as implications for experiments.},

Such invariants protect the “topological insulator” phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z2 invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z2 invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.},

	abstract = {Topological surface states are a class of novel electronic states that are of potential interest in quantum computing or spintronic applications. Unlike conventional two-dimensional electron states, these surface states are expected to be immune to localization and to overcome barriers caused by material imperfection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that topological surface states do not backscatter between equal and opposite momentum states, owing to their chiral spin texture. However, so far there is no evidence that these states in fact transmit through naturally occurring surface defects. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the transmission and reflection probabilities of topological surface states of antimony through naturally occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces. In contrast to non-topological surface states of common metals (copper, silver and gold), which are either reflected or absorbed by atomic steps, we show that topological surface states of antimony penetrate such barriers with high probability. This demonstration of the extended nature of antimony’s topological surface states suggests that such states may be useful for high current transmission even in the presence of atomic-scale irregularities—an electronic feature sought to efficiently interconnect nanoscale devices.},

	abstract = {We construct a theory of charge transport by the surface states of topological insulators in three dimensions. The focus is on the experimentally relevant case when the Fermi energy {εF} and transport scattering time τ satisfy {εFτ/ℏ⪢1} but {εF} lies below the bottom of the conduction band. Our theory is based on the spin density matrix and takes the quantum Liouville equation as its starting point. The scattering term is determined to linear order in the impurity density ni and explicitly accounts for the absence of backscattering while screening is included in the random-phase approximation. The main contribution to the conductivity is ∝ni−1 and has different carrier density dependencies for different forms of scattering while an additional contribution is independent of ni. The dominant scattering angles can be inferred by studying the ratio of the transport time to the Bloch lifetime as a function of the Wigner-Seitz radius rs. The current generates a spin polarization that could provide a smoking-gun signature of surface state transport. We also discuss the effect on the surface states of adding metallic contacts.},
