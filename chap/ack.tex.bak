\noindent First and foremost, I'd like to thank the most focused, understanding and supportive advisor anyone could ask for, Erhai Zhao. Not only have I learned more about physics than I could ever imagine, he has mentored me on being a good scientist, and a disciplined worker. I really could not have asked for a better advisor to lead me through this fascinating journey.
I'd like to thank Dr. Papa for his incredible generosity from day one. He supported me throughout my PhD and without that support I would not have succesfully completed the many projects and publications I have had. 
I consider Paul So to be more than just a graduate department advisor. You could add resident psychologist to his title and it would be wholly appropriate. Without his clear guidance on all topics, including ones beyond physics and art, I would be a lost soul. 
I thank Mike Summers for his help as a department chair and helping me in times in need. He's supported me financially at times and has always had an open door for me and any graduate student to talk to him.
Joe Weingartner would be considered the ``House Dad'' of the fraternity of the physics department. He has been a guiding light to me in many ways including physics and life. He is without a doubt one of the most important people the department has given tenure to for his kindness and empathy for anyone who walks into his office.
I am very grateful to Indu Satija for her amazing creativity and beautiful ability to see physics like no one has. I give her full credit for the idea that spawned my most fascinating project of the driven quantum Hall system. 
I thank Predrag Nikolic, not only as helpful committee member but as great educator. He has always welcomed healthy discussion about a variety of topics that have helped me in my career numerous times.
Qilian Li has been one of the most excited and appreciative members I could have on my committee. His enthusiasm in my work has been a heavy driver for a signifact portion of my research.
Ming Tian was the first person to take me in under her wing as a student. She saw I had potential and ability to do physics and immediately gave me challenging problems to work on. She has been very supportive of my endeavours even if it meant changing groups.
Without Kathleen Enos, Mari-Elaine Triolo, Geoff Elkins, Stephanie Monk, and Melissa Hayes I would be wrapped up in more paperwork than I could handle. They have made my this trip as smooth as possible and have been the best people to have around.
Of course without Dan Thomas and Andrew Abdalian I'd be a headless chicken running around with regards to my IT issues.
Phil Rubin was the person that urged me to apply to the program regardless of my physics background because he believed I'd do great. Somehow he was right. I later learned Phil was in a psychology PhD program when he switched to physics. That's serious inspiration.
Gerald Cook was the first Professor I interacted with in my desire to start back in grad school. He was very enthusiastic for me to begin this journey.
Stephen Gildea for inspiring me to go to graduate school by becoming a rocket scientist and kicking ass at it.
Anish Mitra, my first friend in graduate school and roommate deserves much recognition for being the one person that was as interested in math and science as I was. 
Indrajit Das and Zrinka Greguric Ferencek are staples in my early career. I owe much to them for their stimulating discussions while we completed course work together. 
Timofey Frolov is my favorite Russian physicist, metal guitarist, food snob I've ever known. He has been a great friend and colleague during our years at GMU before he ditched me for Berkeley. Ol' Dirty himself, Greg Byrne, deserves more than a mention here for our antics during these years especially at the Arlington Office.
Many thanks go to Devin Vega and our enjoyable and stimulating discussions in course work and research under Ming Tian.
Quite importantly, I'd like to thank Lois Cohen, Edmund Lau, and Jean Wright for their influence during my formative high school years.  I owe them more than just a line in this theses and without them I truly would not be here. The same goes for Anand Rangarajan and Eric Schwartz from my time at University of Florida, two professors who challenged me in innovative and creative ways.
Not least, I'd like to thank SPACS, Office of Naval Research, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology for the funding they have provided me over these years.
