	abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity (or superconductivity with a nontrivial Cooper pairing) is believed to exist in many heavy-fermion materials as well as in high temperature superconductors, and is a subject of great theoretical and experimental interest. The remarkable progress achieved in this field has not been reflected in published monographs and textbooks, and there is a gap between current research and the standard education of solid state physicists in the theory of superconductivity. This book is intended to meet this information need and includes the authors' original results.},
