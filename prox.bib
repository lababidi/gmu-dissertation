	abstract = {We report a transport study of exfoliated few monolayer crystals of topological insulator {Bi2Se3} in an electric field effect geometry. By doping the bulk crystals with Ca, we are able to fabricate devices with sufficiently low bulk carrier density to change the sign of the Hall density with the gate voltage Vg. We find that the temperature T and magnetic field dependent transport properties in the vicinity of this Vg can be explained by a bulk channel with activation gap of approximately 50 {meV} and a relatively high-mobility metallic channel that dominates at low T. The conductance (approximately 2×7e2/h), weak antilocalization, and metallic resistance-temperature profile of the latter lead us to identify it with the protected surface state. The relative smallness of the observed gap implies limitations for electric field effect topological insulator devices at room temperature.},

We obtain results for the pair amplitude and the local density of states {(DOS)} as a function of doping and of the geometrical parameters determining the width of the structures. The superconducting correlations are found to penetrate the normal graphene layers even when there is extreme mismatch in the normal and superconducting doping levels, where specular Andreev reflection dominates. The local {DOS} exhibits peculiar features, which we discuss, arising from the Dirac cone dispersion relation and from the interplay between the superconducting and Thouless energy scales. The corresponding characteristic energies emerge in the form of resonant peaks in the local {DOS}, which depend strongly on the doping level, as does the energy gap, which declines sharply as the relative difference in doping between the S and N regions is reduced. We also linearize the {DBdG} equations and develop an essentially analytical method that determines the critical temperature Tc of a {S∣N∣S} nanostructure self-consistently. We find that for S regions that occupy a fraction of the coherence length, Tc can undergo substantial variations as a function of the relative doping. At finite temperatures and by manipulating the doping levels, the self-consistent pair amplitudes reveal dramatic transitions between a superconducting and resistive normal state of the structure. Such behavior suggests the possibility of using the proposed system as a carbon-based superconducting switch, turning superconductivity on or off by tuning the relative doping levels.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional {(2D)} topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional {(3D)} topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized {2D} Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on {HgTe∕CdTe} quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on {Bi1−xSbx}, {Bi2Se3}, {Bi2Te3}, and {Sb2Te3} are then discussed that establish these materials as {3D} topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a {3D} topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

The formation of surface states and their dependence on the magnetization orientation is investigated, and it is found that these states are Majorana fermions in the dxy-wave case in stark contrast to the topologically trivial {high-Tc} cuprates. The signature of such states in the conductance spectra is studied, and we also compute the supercurrent which flows on the surface of the topological insulator when a Josephson junction is deposited on top of it. It is found that the current exhibits an anomalous current-phase relation when the region separating the superconducting banks is ferromagnetic, and we also show that in contrast to the metallic case the exchange field in such a scenario does not induce 0-π oscillations in the critical current. Similarly to the {high-Tc} cuprates, the presence of zero-energy surface states on the topological surface leads to a strong low-temperature enhancement of the critical current.},

The Josephson coupling changes from 0 to π as function of {dF}, and—very close to the crossover thickness—as function of temperature.

	abstract = {We show that an ordinary semiconducting thin film with spin-orbit coupling can, under appropriate circumstances, be in a quantum topologically ordered state supporting exotic Majorana excitations which follow {non-Abelian} statistics. The key to the quantum topological order is the coexistence of spin-orbit coupling with proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity and an externally induced Zeeman coupling of the spins. For the Zeeman coupling below a critical value, the system is a nontopological (proximity-induced) s-wave superconductor. However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical value, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy Majorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a {non-Abelian} s-wave superconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition {(TQPT)} tuned by the Zeeman coupling. In the topological phase, since the time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken by the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian, the edge of the film constitutes a chiral Majorana wire. Just like the s-wave superconductivity, the Zeeman coupling can also be proximity induced in the film by an adjacent magnetic insulator. We show this by an explicit model tight-binding calculation for both types of proximity effects in the heterostructure geometry. Here we show that the same {TQPT} can be accessed by varying the interface transparency between the film and the superconductor. For the transparency below (above) a critical value, the system is a topological (regular) s-wave superconductor. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure and for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized Majorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum nanowire. In this case, the Zeeman coupling can be induced more easily by an external magnetic field parallel to the wire, obviating the need for a magnetic insulator. We show that, despite the fact that the superconducting pair potential in the nanowire is explicitly s wave, tunneling of electrons to the ends of the wire reveals a pronounced zero-bias peak. Such a peak is absent when the Zeeman coupling is below its critical value, i.e., the nanowire is in the nontopological s-wave superconducting state. We argue that the observation of this zero-bias tunneling peak in the semiconductor nanowire is possibly the simplest and clearest experiment proposed so far to unambiguously detect a Majorana fermion mode in a condensed-matter system.},

For l≠0, these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair wave function that is asympototically the same as that in the {Moore-Read} {(Pfaffian)} quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge states, quasihole, and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating that nonabelian statistics is a generic property of such a paired phase. The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the {Haldane-Rezayi} state is not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian phase, which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken U(1) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem, the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero tunneling there is a transition to the {Moore-Read} phase. The effects of disorder on noninteracting quasiparticles are considered. The gapped phases survive, but there is an intermediate thermally conducting phase in the spinless p-wave case, in which the quasiparticles are extended.},

In the vicinity of the Dirac cone vertex, the effective model describing the states localized at the interface is well approximated by a model of Dirac electrons experiencing superconducting s-wave pairing. Away from the cone vertex, the induced pairing potential develops a p-wave component with a magnitude sensitive to the structure of the interface. Observing the induced s-wave superconductivity may require tuning the chemical potential close to the Dirac point. Furthermore, we find that the proximity of the superconductor leads to a significant renormalization of the original parameters of the effective model describing the surface states of a topological insulator.},

	abstract = {We propose a model for conventional superconductors in contact with a ferromagnetic (or polarized paramagnetic) insulator. The model is defined by a boundary condition on the quasiclassical Green’s function for the superconductor at the interface between the metal and insulating magnet. The specific boundary condition we use describes the interaction of the electrons, which tunnel into the insulating barrier, with the average exchange field of the local moments. Solutions to the quasiclassical equations and boundary condition are obtained for thin superconducting films. We obtain results for pair-breaking effects of a magnetic boundary on the transition temperature and gap of thin superconducting films. Of particular interest is the Zeeman effect in the quasiparticle density of states {(DOS)}, which exhibits a splitting of the form {2μe(H+B*)} in an external field H. The excess splitting B* is interpreted here as an internal field in the superconductor resulting from quasiparticle tunneling into the magnetic insulator, and subsequent reflection into the superconducting film. We compare our model of the tunneling {DOS} with the recent measurements by Tedrow et al. on {EuO/Al/Al2O3} tunnel junctions.},

We use these results to extract the relevant proximity lengths. We find that the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet exhibit a damped oscillatory behavior that is reflected in both the pair amplitude and the local density of states. The characteristic length scale of these oscillations is approximately inversely proportional to the exchange field, and is independent of the superconducting coherence length in the range studied. We find the superconducting coherence length to be nearly independent of the ferromagnetic polarization.},

This heterostructure was proposed recently as a platform for observing {non-Abelian} statistics and performing topological quantum computation. The dependence of the Majorana zero energy states and the minigaps on various physics parameters {(Zeeman} field, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling strength) is characterized. We find the minigaps depend strongly on the spin-orbit coupling strength. In certain parameter region, the minigaps are linearly proportional to the s-wave superconducting pairing gap Δs, which is very different from the Δs2 dependence in a regular s- or p-wave superconductor. We characterize the zero energy chiral edge state at the boundary and calculate the scanning tunneling microscopy signal in the vortex core that shows a pronounced zero energy peak. We show that the Majorana zero energy states are robust in the presence of various types of impurities. We find the existence of impurity potential may increase the minigaps and thus benefit topological quantum computation.},
